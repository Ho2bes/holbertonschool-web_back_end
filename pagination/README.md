# Pagination Project

This repository contains an implementation of **pagination** in an application. The project demonstrates how to divide large datasets into smaller, manageable pages and return paginated results from a database or an API.

## üìù Project Overview

Pagination helps to improve the performance and user experience of applications dealing with large datasets. By loading only a subset of data at a time (i.e., one page), pagination reduces the memory usage and speeds up the response time of your system. This project covers different pagination techniques, such as offset-based and cursor-based pagination, using both SQL databases and NoSQL databases.

### Key Concepts:
- **Offset-based Pagination**: Fetching data using a `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` strategy, commonly used in SQL queries.
- **Cursor-based Pagination**: Using a cursor to fetch data from a specific point onwards, often used in NoSQL databases.
- **API Pagination**: Returning paginated results in API responses, including metadata like total pages and current page.
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading data in chunks as the user scrolls or navigates, improving performance and reducing the initial load.

### Skills Gained:
- Implementing offset-based and cursor-based pagination techniques.
- Adding pagination to API responses with appropriate metadata.
- Optimizing queries to fetch data more efficiently in large datasets.
- Handling edge cases like last page, first page, and empty results.
