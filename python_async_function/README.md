# Python Async Functions Project

This repository contains an implementation of **asynchronous functions** in Python. The project demonstrates how to work with Python's `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently using asynchronous functions.

## üìù Project Overview

**Asynchronous functions** in Python allow for concurrent execution of tasks that would otherwise block the execution of the program, such as I/O-bound tasks (reading files, querying databases, making HTTP requests, etc.). This project focuses on learning how to define and work with asynchronous functions, and how to use them in real-world scenarios to improve performance and responsiveness in Python applications.

### Key Concepts:
- **async/await**: Python keywords used to define asynchronous functions and handle asynchronous operations.
- **Concurrency**: Running multiple tasks at the same time without waiting for one to finish before starting another.
- **Event Loop**: A core concept in Python's `asyncio` library that manages and schedules asynchronous tasks.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Handling I/O operations without blocking the execution of the rest of the program.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing and managing asynchronous functions using the `async` and `await` syntax.
- Understanding how the Python event loop works to handle asynchronous operations.
- Handling multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently using `asyncio.gather()` and `asyncio.create_task()`.
- Applying asynchronous functions to real-world I/O-bound tasks, improving efficiency and performance.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-basic_async_function.py**: A simple asynchronous function that simulates a delay using `await asyncio.sleep()`.
- **1-concurrent_tasks.py**: Demonstrates how to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`.
- **2-awaiting_results.py**: Shows how to await results from multiple asynchronous functions.
- **3-non_blocking_io.py**: Implements non-blocking I/O operations using asynchronous functions to improve performance.
