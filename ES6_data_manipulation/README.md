# ES6 Data Manipulation Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **ES6_data_manipulation** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on learning and applying ES6 features to manipulate data structures such as arrays, maps, and sets in JavaScript.

## üìù Project Overview

ES6 introduced powerful tools for data manipulation in JavaScript. This project explores these tools, including methods for working with arrays, sets, and maps. You will learn how to efficiently manipulate and transform data using ES6 methods, helping to write cleaner and more efficient JavaScript code.

### Key Concepts:
- **Arrays**: Using array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `find` to transform and query arrays.
- **Sets**: Working with the `Set` object to store unique values and perform set operations.
- **Maps**: Using the `Map` object to store key-value pairs with flexible keys.
- **Arrow Functions**: Utilizing concise arrow functions for data manipulation.
- **Spread and Rest Operators**: Applying these operators to simplify working with collections of data.

### Skills Gained:
- Manipulating and transforming arrays using ES6 methods.
- Understanding the differences between `Set` and `Map` objects and how to use them effectively.
- Writing concise and efficient code using arrow functions and modern ES6 syntax.
