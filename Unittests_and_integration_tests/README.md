# Unit Testing and Integration Testing Project

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing unit tests and integration tests in Python. Unit testing ensures that individual functions work as expected, while integration testing verifies that different parts of the code work together seamlessly.

## Features

- Unit tests for individual functions.
- Integration tests for end-to-end code paths.
- Use of mocking to isolate functions under test.
- Parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios.
- Fixtures for setting up test environments.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.9
- `unittest` framework
- `unittest.mock` library
- `parameterized` library
