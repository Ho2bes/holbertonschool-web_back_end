# ES6 Classes Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **ES6_classes** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript using the ES6 class syntax.

## üìù Project Overview

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced a new class syntax for writing object-oriented JavaScript. This project explores the use of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript. The goal is to understand how to build reusable and scalable objects using classes, constructors, and methods.

### Key Concepts:
- **Classes**: Defining object templates in JavaScript.
- **Constructors**: Initializing objects with specific properties.
- **Methods**: Functions defined within classes that operate on object data.
- **Inheritance**: Creating subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
- **Super Keyword**: Calling a parent class's constructor or methods from a subclass.
- **Encapsulation**: Organizing code and hiding data within classes.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing JavaScript classes using the ES6 syntax.
- Implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance and encapsulation.
- Using constructors to initialize object properties.
- Creating reusable code by extending base classes through inheritance.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-classroom.js**: Defines a `Classroom` class with properties like `name` and `students`.
- **1-initialize_rooms.js**: Demonstrates how to create and initialize multiple instances of the `Classroom` class.
- **2-holberton_course.js**: Defines a `HolbertonCourse` class with properties like `courseName`, `numberOfStudents`, and methods to access or modify these properties.
- **3-student.js**: Implements a `Student` class with methods for retrieving and setting student data.
- **4-teacher.js**: Defines a `Teacher` class that extends the `Person` class, adding specific teacher-related properties and methods.
- **5-inheritance.js**: Demonstrates inheritance in JavaScript by creating subclasses that extend base classes.
- **6-method_overriding.js**: Shows how to override methods in a subclass using the `super` keyword to access the parent class's methods.
