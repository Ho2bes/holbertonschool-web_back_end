# NoSQL Project

This repository contains the solutions for a **NoSQL** project. The project focuses on understanding the principles of NoSQL databases, specifically non-relational data storage, and how to interact with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.

## üìù Project Overview

**NoSQL** databases provide a flexible, schema-less approach to storing and managing data, which is different from traditional SQL databases. This project covers the basics of NoSQL, the differences between relational and non-relational databases, and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a NoSQL environment.

### Key Concepts:
- **Non-relational Databases**: Understanding the core principles behind NoSQL databases and their advantages.
- **Document Stores**: Working with document-based databases such as MongoDB, where data is stored in JSON-like formats (BSON).
- **Scalability**: Exploring how NoSQL databases handle large-scale data and horizontal scaling.
- **CRUD Operations**: Learning how to perform basic database operations such as inserting, querying, updating, and deleting documents.

### Skills Gained:
- Understanding the key differences between NoSQL and SQL databases.
- Working with MongoDB to store, retrieve, and manipulate documents.
- Using NoSQL databases for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Applying NoSQL database models to real-world applications that require scalability and flexibility.
