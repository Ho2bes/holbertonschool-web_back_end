# ES6 Basics Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **ES6_basics** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding the essential features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the latest version of JavaScript, which brings new syntax and functionalities to improve code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

## üìù Project Overview

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduces several new features to JavaScript, including arrow functions, template literals, classes, and more. This project covers the basics of ES6 and how these features improve modern JavaScript development.

### Key Concepts:
- **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for writing functions.
- **Template Literals**: String literals that allow embedded expressions.
- **Let and Const**: Block-scoped variable declarations.
- **Destructuring**: Simplifying the extraction of values from arrays and objects.
- **Spread and Rest Operators**: Handling arrays and function arguments more flexibly.
- **Classes**: Defining object-oriented structures in JavaScript.
- **Modules**: Importing and exporting code between different files.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing cleaner and more efficient JavaScript using ES6 syntax.
- Understanding how to apply ES6 features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals in real-world projects.
- Organizing code with modules and creating reusable components.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-constants.js**: Demonstrates the use of `const` and `let` for variable declarations.
- **1-block-scoped.js**: Example of block-scoped variables and functions.
- **2-arrow_functions.js**: Introduction to arrow functions and how they differ from regular functions.
- **3-default_params.js**: Using default parameters in functions.
- **4-rest_parameters.js**: Demonstrates the use of the rest operator to handle an indefinite number of arguments in functions.
- **5-spread_operator.js**: Shows how to use the spread operator to expand arrays and objects.
- **6-string_interpolation.js**: Using template literals to embed expressions inside strings.
- **7-object_destructuring.js**: Simplifying object property access with destructuring.
- **8-classes.js**: Defining and using classes in JavaScript.
- **9-modules.js**: Importing and exporting functions and variables between files.
