# Python Variable Annotations Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **python_variable_annotations** project. The project focuses on understanding and applying type annotations in Python to improve code clarity, error detection, and tooling support.

## üìù Project Overview

**Variable annotations** in Python allow developers to explicitly declare the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values. Type annotations don't enforce the types at runtime, but they provide valuable information for static type checkers (like `mypy`) and help improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

### Key Concepts:
- **Type Annotations**: Adding type hints to variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Static Type Checking**: Using tools like `mypy` to check the correctness of type annotations.
- **PEP 484**: The Python Enhancement Proposal that introduced type hints and annotations.
- **Optional Types**: Handling variables that could be of multiple types or `None`.

### Skills Gained:
- Using type hints to annotate variables and function signatures.
- Understanding how to check for type consistency with tools like `mypy`.
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable Python code by explicitly specifying expected types.
- Utilizing complex types like `List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`, `Union`, and `Optional`.
