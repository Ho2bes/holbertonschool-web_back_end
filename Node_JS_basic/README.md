# NodeJS Project

## Description
This project is designed to help you get started with NodeJS and cover essential concepts like modules, file reading, HTTP servers, and command-line arguments. You will also work with ExpressJS for advanced routing, Babel for ES6 support, and Nodemon for development efficiency.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Run JavaScript using NodeJS
- Use NodeJS modules
- Read files using specific NodeJS modules
- Use `process` to access command-line arguments and environment variables
- Create a small HTTP server using NodeJS
- Create a small HTTP server using ExpressJS
- Create advanced routes with ExpressJS
- Use ES6 with NodeJS via Babel-node
- Use Nodemon for faster development

## Requirements

- Use the `.js` extension for your code.
- Tests should be written using Jest, and run using `npm run test`.
- Code should follow the linting rules of ESLint and pass lint tests using `npm run full-test`.
- All functions/classes must be exported using `module.exports = myFunction`.
